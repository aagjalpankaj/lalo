# Laravel Log Validator

**Laravel Log Validator** validates logs at runtime in non-production environments, helping to make logging more concise and consistent across your application.

It not only validates logs but also adds additional application metadata, making log aggregation, searching, and analysis more efficient.

It is built on top of [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog), so you stream logs wherever you want.

## Installation

Install the package:
```bash
composer require aagjalpankaj/laravel-log-validator
```

Create custom channel in `logging.php`:
```bash
'custom' => [
    'driver' => 'custom',
    'via' => Aagjalpankaj\LaravelLogValidator\Logger::class,
    'level' => env('LOG_LEVEL', 'debug'),
    'handler' => StreamHandler::class,
    'formatter' => env('LOG_STDERR_FORMATTER'),
    'with' => [
        storage_path('logs/laravel.log'),
        'debug',
    ],
    'processors' => [PsrLogMessageProcessor::class],
],
```

Update logging driver in `.env`:
```bash
LOG_CHANNEL=custom
```
